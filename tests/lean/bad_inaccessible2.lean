/- The following definition fails because the pattern variables are
   introduced in the following order:
         a va n b vb
   However, the type of va must be (vec A n). That is, it depends
   on a variable introduced after va.

   The error message is confusing.

   Alternatives:
   1- Ignore the problem since this is a very obscure use of inaccessible terms.
   2- Reorder variables based on their occurrence in inaccessible terms.
      If we do that, the variables in the pattern will be ordered as:
            n a va b vb
      and this example will work. This is not fully satisfactor since
      we can create another declaration where this heuristic is not the right
      solution.
   3- Produce a better error message.
