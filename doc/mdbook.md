This manual is generated by [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). We are currently using a
[fork](https://github.com/leanprover/mdBook) of it for the following additional features:

* Add support for hiding lines in other languages [#1339](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1339)

To build this manual, first install the fork via
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/leanprover/mdBook mdbook
```
Then use e.g. [`mdbook watch`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/cli/watch.html) in the `doc/` folder:
```
cd doc
mdbook watch --open  # opens the output in `out/` in your default browser
```
