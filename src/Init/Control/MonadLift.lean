Classy functions for lifting monadic actions of different shapes.

This theory is roughly modeled after the Haskell 'layers' package https://hackage.haskell.org/package/layers-0.1.
Please see https://hackage.haskell.org/package/layers-0.1/docs/Documentation-Layers-Overview.html for an exhaustive discussion of the different approaches to lift functions.
