Classy functions for lifting monadic actions of different shapes.

This theory is roughly modeled after the Haskell 'layers' package https://hackage.haskell.org/package/layers-0.1.
Please see https://hackage.haskell.org/package/layers-0.1/docs/Documentation-Layers-Overview.html for an exhaustive discussion of the different approaches to lift functions.

/-- A Function for lifting a computation from an inner Monad to an outer Monad.
    Like [MonadTrans](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.5.5.0/docs/Control-Monad-Trans-Class.html),
    but `n` does not have to be a monad transformer.
    Alternatively, an implementation of [MonadLayer](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/layers-0.1/docs/Control-Monad-Layer.html#t:MonadLayer) without `layerInvmap` (so far). -/
class MonadLift (m : Type u → Type v) (n : Type u → Type w) :=
(monadLift : ∀ {α}, m α → n α)

/-- The reflexive-transitive closure of `MonadLift`.
    `monadLift` is used to transitively lift monadic computations such as `StateT.get` or `StateT.put s`.
    Corresponds to [MonadLift](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/layers-0.1/docs/Control-Monad-Layer.html#t:MonadLift). -/
class MonadLiftT (m : Type u → Type v) (n : Type u → Type w) :=
(monadLift : ∀ {α}, m α → n α)

export MonadLiftT (monadLift)

abbrev liftM := @monadLift
