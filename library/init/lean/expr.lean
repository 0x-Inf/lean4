TODO(Leo): fix the `mvar` constructor.
In Lean3 (and Lean4), we have two kinds of metavariables: regular and temporary.
The type of regular metavariables is stored in the metavar_context.
The type of temporary metavariables is stored in the metavar itself. This decision is legacy from Lean2.
Moreover, the `name` in temporary metavariables are supposed to be (small) numerals. So,
we can store their assignment as an array. Actually, it is a numeral with a hidden unique prefix.
The decision of storing the type of the tmp metavar is also debatable.
For example, we can avoid this by have another array with their types.
For regular metavariables, the `expr` field is a dummy value.

We should have two different constructors:
`| mvar : name → expr` for regular metavariables
and
`| tmvar : usize → expr` for temporary metavariables
The `usize` makes it clear that we can use arrays to store tmp metavar assignments and their types.
